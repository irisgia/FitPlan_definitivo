          <small><p class="hiitliss" class="text-left">High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a form of exercise
            in which you alternate between very intense anaerobic periods and slower recovery periods
            for a shorter, more efficient workout.</p><br>

            <p class="hiitliss" class="text-center">How to do HIIT?</p><br>

            <p class="hiitliss" class="text-left">- Tabata protocol  -  It is one of the most common methods of doing HIIT.<br>
            Pick an activity and go all-out for 20 seconds, and then rest for 10 seconds. <br>
            Repeat this cycle 8 times straight for a total of 4 minutes. Simple enough.<br>
            &emsp; <br>
            Try and pick exercises that recruit the most muscles possible for maximum fat burning, like:<br>
            &emsp;<br>
            &emsp;Sprints<br>
            &emsp;Elliptical Machine<br>
            &emsp;Rowing Machine <br>
            &emsp;Stationary Bike</p><br>


            <p class="hiitliss" class="text-left">- Weighted circuits  -  Using resistance exercises can be a very effective method of doing HIIT.<br>
            To use resistance training, choose compound exercises that are good "oxygen suckers", such as:<br>
            &emsp;<br>
            &emsp;Burpees<br>
            &emsp;Kettlebell swings or snatches<br>
            &emsp;Jumping squats<br>
            &emsp; <br>
            - Combo exercises are also good choices. For instance:<br>
            do a pullup, drop down, do a pushup, jump back up to the pullup bar for another pullup, and so on<br>
            hang clean + front squat + overhead press<br>
            dumbbell snatch + wrestler's sprawl<br>
            &emsp; <br>
            - You can also combine resistance exercises with "cardio" type exercises.<br>
            For example<br>
            alternate a set of dumbbell swings with 100 m sprints<br>
            sprint up a hill, then do a fast set of pushups at the top<br>
            carry a heavy sandbag for speed</p><br>

          <h3 class="exercises">L.I.S.S.</h3>
              <small><p class="hiitliss" class="text-left"> Low Intensity Steady State (LISS) is a cardio workout
                that lasts between 30-60 minutes spent in the 60% of your max heart rate zone, also known as the
                fat burning zone. By maintaining a steady pace for an extended period of time, it helps promote
                fat loss, increased blood flow and improvement in overall endurance.<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                For LISS, your activity is more moderate, so that you are able to speak well enough to carry
                on a conversation - like going on a jog with a buddy or working out on side-by-side stationary bikes at the gym.<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                As it is low impact and low risk, it is perfect for an active rest and recovery day.
                It can be a good way to build up to harder workouts for those that are just starting to exercise.
                It also presents a way to lose weight without exerting a lot of energy.<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                Examples of LISS Cardio:<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Power Walking / Slow Jogging  -  You can do it on the treadmill, at the gym or just get up and head outside. <br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Elliptical  -  If you want to mix it up from the treadmill, hop on the elliptical. Pedal briskly for 15 minutes
                forward and then for the remaining 15 minutes pedal in reverse.<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Hill walks or incline on a treadmill<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Moderate swimming in a pool or the sea<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Walking up large sets of stairs or stair stepper machines<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Using a cross trainer or elliptical machine<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Steady rowing or rowing machines<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Steady cycling or using an exercise bike<br>
                &emsp;<br>
                - Swimming  -  A great example of this type of LISS is to swim the length of the pool continuously for 25-30 minutes.<br>
                To engage other muscle groups, switch up your strokes throughout the workout.<br>
